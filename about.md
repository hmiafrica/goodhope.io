Hope Ministries is dedicated to serving the poor living in the ghettos of Nairobi, Kenya, East Africa. The organization was founded in 1993 by Rev. George and Ruth Muroki out of a desire to live their commitment to Jesus and share God's love in tangible ways by meeting the felt needs of some of Kenya's most marginalized and impoverished people.

Our main goals:
1. Share the good news of God's love through the teachings and work of Jesus Christ
2. Serve impoverished residents of the Nairobi ghettos through aid and service programs
3. Train local ministers to serve their local communities

Hope Ministries ministers by meeting both physical and spiritual needs of people, leading teams of workers to distribute food and clothing that HMI ships to Kenya, as well as preaching to salvation and the Gospel of Jesus Christ in yearly open-air crusades, youth rallies, and pastor’s conferences.

The goal of HMI is to make disciples, teach people to improve themselves and their lifestyles, and prepare them to go out and do the same for others. HMI accomplishes this goal by reaching children and adults alike, providing day-care and pre-primary education at the Good Hope Christian Center in Kariobangi South, Nairobi, to prepare children living in the surrounding ghetto for primary school.

Hope Ministries is an organization of people dedicated to carrying out the commission of Jesus Christ by bring hope to a world in need. To support HMI, send your tax-deductible gift to: Hope Ministries International, 854 9th Ave., Brackenridge, PA, 15014.

Any financial gifts or other donations or food, clothing, church and building equipment that will help us meet our goals are greatly appreciated and will be useful in carrying out the mission of HMI. If you can’t donate, please pray.  

Life is filled with opportunities. Don’t miss the opportunity to give hope to those in need of hope. After all, Jesus said, “When you do it unto the least of these, you do it unto me.”
