      <h3>Schools</h3>

      <p>
        Hope Ministries operates schools for children living in the ghettos around Home Ministries facilities in Kariobangi South and the village of Kinani.
      </p>

      <p>
        These schools provide a daytime education program that helps prepare these children for later schooling, and helps community parents by caring for the children during critical working hours.
